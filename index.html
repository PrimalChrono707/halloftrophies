        I made these as Christmas Cookies this year. (Don't tell anyone, but I had to take these pictures right after they baked because the ears fell off when I tried controls to move them.)

        I also have a custom FNAF song that I had ai generate:
        <audio controls src="I always come back.mp3"></audio>

    <p>Creating a multi-function software from scratch that handles 3D animation, 2D animation, video editing, and audio editing with a wide array of extra editing functions is a massive undertaking. This would be a project comparable in scale to software like Adobe's Creative Suite or Blender. However, here's a breakdown of the key considerations, technologies, and a simplified conceptual outline to give you a starting point.

**I. Core Principles and Architecture**

*   **Modularity:**  Design the software with a modular architecture. This means breaking down the application into independent modules or "components" that handle specific tasks.  This makes the code easier to manage, test, and update.  Each module can have its own dedicated UI and data structures. For instance:
    *   **3D Module:**  Handles the creation, manipulation, and animation of 3D models.
    *   **2D Module:**  Focuses on vector graphics, raster images, and 2D animation.
    *   **Video Editing Module:**  Manages video clips, transitions, effects, and rendering.
    *   **Audio Editing Module:**  Deals with audio tracks, waveforms, effects, and mixing.
    *   **UI Module:** Manages user interface elements (menus, toolbars, panels).
    *   **Rendering Module:** responsible for rendering images, videos and animations.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** Define a clear API for communication between modules. This allows them to share data and trigger events.
*   **Data Structures:** Implement efficient data structures to represent:
    *   **3D Data:** Models (meshes, textures, materials), animation data (skeletons, keyframes, animation curves).
    *   **2D Data:** Vector graphics (paths, shapes, fills, strokes), raster images, frame data for animations.
    *   **Video Data:** Video clips (frames, codecs, resolutions), audio tracks.
    *   **Audio Data:** Audio samples, waveforms, effects parameters.
*   **Undo/Redo System:** Essential for any creative software. Implement a history stack to track user actions.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Aim for cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) from the beginning to broaden your user base.

**II. Technology Choices**

*   **Programming Languages:**
    *   **C++:**  Often preferred for performance-critical applications (3D, rendering) due to its speed and direct memory control.
    *   **Python:** Can be used for scripting, automation, and integration, and potentially for parts of the UI.
    *   **C#:** Also useful for building Windows-based applications, specifically using the .NET framework.
*   **UI Frameworks:**
    *   **Qt:** A powerful, cross-platform C++ framework with a robust UI library.  Popular for applications like Blender, KDEnlive.
    *   **wxWidgets:** Another cross-platform C++ framework.
    *   **Dear ImGui:**  An "immediate mode" GUI library, often used for custom tools.
    *   **.NET MAUI or WPF:**  If you're primarily targeting Windows and using C#.
*   **3D Graphics:**
    *   **OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX:** For rendering 3D scenes. Vulkan is more modern and potentially more efficient but has a steeper learning curve. OpenGL is cross-platform, while DirectX is Windows-specific.
    *   **Libraries like OpenGL Mathematics (GLM):**  Provides vector and matrix math operations.
    *   **Scene Graph:** Consider a scene graph to organize and manage 3D objects in the scene (e.g., OpenSceneGraph).
*   **2D Graphics:**
    *   **OpenGL or a 2D graphics library:**  For rendering 2D vector graphics and images (e.g., Cairo, Skia, or a cross-platform library like Qt).
*   **Video and Audio Processing:**
    *   **FFmpeg:** A widely used, open-source library that handles video and audio codecs, decoding, encoding, and format conversions.  Essential for reading and writing various media formats.
    *   **Audio libraries:**  Libraries like PortAudio for cross-platform audio input/output and effects processing.
    *   **Video Editing Libraries (Optional):** Consider libraries focused on video editing functions, though many will utilize FFmpeg as a core component.
*   **Scripting:**
    *   **Lua or Python:** For scripting, allowing users to automate tasks and extend the software's functionality.

    *   **Documentation:**  Write clear and concise documentation for the code and the software itself.

4.  **Deployment and Maintenance:**
    *   **Packaging:** Package the software for distribution on different platforms.
    *   **Release Management:**  Plan for regular releases with new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
    *   **Support:**  Provide support to your users (forums, documentation, FAQs).

**V. Important Notes and Challenges**

*   **Learning Curve:** This is a massive project, and the learning curve will be steep. Be prepared to spend a lot of time learning the required technologies.
*   **Performance:**  3D animation, video editing, and audio processing are all computationally intensive tasks.  Optimize your code for performance, especially for rendering and effect processing.
*   **User Experience (UX):**  Pay careful attention to the user experience.  The software should be intuitive and easy to use, even with its complex functionality.
*   **Time and Resources:** This project will likely take several years (or more) of dedicated effort by a team of developers.  You'll need to manage your time and resources effectively.  Consider whether you have the skills to do this alone, or if you will need to hire help.
*   **Monetization:** Consider how you will monetize the software (e.g., paid licenses, subscriptions, freemium model).

**VI. Simplified Example of Data Flow (Illustrative)**

1.  **User Input:** The user interacts with the UI to create a 3D model using tools in the 3D Module.
2.  **Data Storage:** The 3D Module stores the model data (vertices, faces, materials) in its own internal data structures.
3.  **Animation:** The user creates an animation for the model using the Rigging and Animation Tools. Animation data (keyframes, etc.) is stored by the 3D Module.
4.  **Render Trigger:** When the user presses the "Render" button or starts playing an animation, the UI Module communicates with the Rendering Module.
5.  **Scene Assembly:** The Rendering Module receives the 3D model and animation data (via the API).
6.  **Rendering:** The Rendering Module uses OpenGL/Vulkan, the shader program, and the 3D model data to generate a frame.
7.  **Frame Output:** The rendered frame is then added to the video or image sequence which is then sent to the Video Editing Module for further processing.
8.  **Video Editing Integration:** The Video Editing Module combines the rendered frames, audio from the Audio Editing Module and 2D animation output from the 2D animation module. The Video Editing Module handles transitions, effects, and audio syncing to create the final output.
9.  **Export:** The user exports the final video, animation, and audio in the desired output format (e.g., MP4).

This is a high-level overview and simplification of an extremely complex project. Each step will require detailed planning, careful design, and rigorous implementation. It's essential to start with a clear vision, a well-defined architecture, and a manageable scope, building and testing each module gradually.  Good luck, it's a long road!
